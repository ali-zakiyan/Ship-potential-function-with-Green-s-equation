# Ship-potential-function-with-Green-s-equation
Calculating the potential flow of objects is the first step to calculate the pressure and force applied on them. By having the potential of the body, you can calculate the speed and also find the pressure from Bernoulli's equation, and by having the pressure, you can calculate the force. It should be noted that the mentioned calculations are without considering the effects of viscosity. The upcoming project aims to solve the potential flow around a tanker ship. The steps of this project are two general parts of meshing geometry and using Green's method (boundary element technique). In the present project, by solving the Laplace equation around the hull of the ship, the velocity potential on the surface and around it is calculated. The prepared code has the ability to expose the ship to free flow without the presence of waves or in the presence of different waves, so that this wave can be linear or non-linear.
